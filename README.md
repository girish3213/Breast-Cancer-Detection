# Breast-Cancer-Detection

The dataset is of UCI, used for breast cancer detection.Eight classification models are been used to find the model of highest accuracy for the given dataset.
# The features used to predict Breast Cancer here are:
  1.Sample code number	
  2.Clump Thickness	
  3.Uniformity of Cell Size	
  4.Uniformity of Cell Shape	
  5.Marginal Adhesion	
  6.Single Epithelial 
  7.Cell Size	
  8.Bare Nuclei	
  9.Bland Chromatin	
  10.Normal Nucleoli	
  11.Mitoses	
  
# The eight models used are:
  1. Decision Tree classification Model (Accuracy : 95.9 % )
  2. K Nearest Neighbours classification Model (Accuracy : 94.7 %)
  3. Kernel SVM classification Model (Accuracy: 95.3 %)
  4. Logistic Regression classification Model (Accuracy: 94.7 %)
  5. Naive Bayes classification Model (Accuracy: 94.1 %)
  6. Random Forest classification Model (Accuracy: 93.5 %)
  7. Support Vector Machine classification Model (Accuracy: 94.1 %)
  8. XGBoost classification Model (Accuracy: 97.8 %)
  
# Therefore, for the given dataset XGBoost classification Model gives the highest accuracy of 97.8 %.
